## Description
PWA (Progressive Web Applications) are becoming a useful tool for developers. They allow data to be saved on the users computer and do not take up space in the database.
I wanted to showcase my ability to develop a PWA using webpack configuration, serviceworker, manifest.json, IndexDB, and deployment to Heroku.
This application will allow the user save the text edit on their computer and use the editor offline.
I learned the developmental processs of a PWA and the importance of reading documentation.
